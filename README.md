# SPI Light Detection
An SPI-Based Smart Lighting System<br>
This project uses the LPC2129 Microcontroller as the main board, which is interfaced with an LDR through the MCP3204 External ADC which communicates with the board using SPI Protocol. As the LDR detects less light, more LEDs are turned on and messages like "GOOD MORNING"/"GOOD EVENING"/"GOOD NIGHT" are displayed on a 4-bit LCD along with a representation of the LDR Input Value and a symbol of a sun which is displayed using CGRAM. The connections to be used to simulate the project in proteus are also given.
